 // Brief Description of what you did. 
WeatherBite is a weather application built with Next.js and TypeScript, allowing users to search for real-time weather updates and a 5-day forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can save up to five favorite cities in local storage and receive randomized food recommendations based on the current temperature. The app is styled with Tailwind CSS and designed for both desktop and mobile experiences, featuring a clean UI with a responsive layout.

Great Work Darryl I like how on you have the fixed background on mobile verson. Great use of Maps also. Tip: fetch your data on a seperate Server.ts file i will help with organization. Also create a .env.local file in the root and place you API Key inside there to hide it. Good Work
